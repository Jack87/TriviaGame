### JavaScript trivia game assignment for timer. Mini trivia questions for kindergarten level. 
Trivia Game JavaScript Homework 

Test you wits on these kindergarten level questions. You'll be surprised the kind of things these little ones might know and that you might not!

The questions were written by a real teacher (Thanks Catalina!) who teaches kindergarten to 5 year olds. 

Each correct answer is accompanied with a corresponding gif. All wrong answers have a gif corresponding with the questions. These are really fun! Even if you get them all right go back and play again to see all the wrong answer gifs (we know you meant to click the wrong answer don't worry no shame here!). If you missed some take note of the correct answer on the answer prompt screen and take another shot at it to see the gif.
